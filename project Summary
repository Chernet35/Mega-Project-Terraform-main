# Terraform Kubernetes RBAC Configuration for Jenkins

## Project Overview

This Terraform project provides a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) solution for Jenkins CI/CD operations in Kubernetes environments. It creates a secure, production-ready permission structure that follows the principle of least privilege while enabling Jenkins to perform essential deployment and management tasks.

## What It Does

The project automates the creation of Kubernetes RBAC resources that allow Jenkins to:

- **Deploy Applications** - Create and manage deployments, services, and pods in the `webapps` namespace
- **Manage Storage** - Handle persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes for dynamic provisioning
- **Configure Networking** - Set up ingresses and manage network-related resources
- **Handle SSL Certificates** - Work with cert-manager ClusterIssuers for automated certificate management
- **Perform Autoscaling** - Create and manage Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

## Key Features

### üîê **Security-First Design**
- Implements principle of least privilege
- Separates namespace-level and cluster-level permissions
- Provides granular access control for different resource types

### üèóÔ∏è **Production-Ready Architecture**
- Modular Terraform design for reusability
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Extensible configuration for custom requirements

### üìã **Complete RBAC Setup**
- **ServiceAccount** - Identity for Jenkins pods
- **Role** - Namespace-scoped permissions for application resources
- **RoleBinding** - Links the role to the service account within the namespace
- **ClusterRole** - Cluster-wide permissions for storage and certificates
- **ClusterRoleBinding** - Links cluster role to service account across the cluster

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly**
- Detailed documentation with examples
- Troubleshooting guides and verification steps
- Flexible variable system for customization

## Use Cases

- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup** - Enable Jenkins to deploy applications automatically
- **Multi-Environment Deployments** - Secure access patterns for different environments
- **DevOps Automation** - Streamline Kubernetes resource management
- **Security Compliance** - Meet organizational security requirements with proper RBAC

## Technical Highlights

- **Terraform-Managed** - Infrastructure as Code approach for consistency and version control
- **Kubernetes-Native** - Uses standard Kubernetes RBAC resources
- **Namespace Isolation** - Restricts most permissions to specific namespaces
- **Extensible Design** - Easy to add custom permissions and rules

## Target Audience

- **DevOps Engineers** setting up CI/CD pipelines
- **Platform Engineers** managing Kubernetes infrastructure
- **Security Teams** implementing proper access controls
- **Development Teams** needing automated deployment capabilities

This project eliminates the complexity of manually configuring Kubernetes RBAC while ensuring security best practices are followed from day one.
